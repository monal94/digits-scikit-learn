# digits-scikit-learn
Hands on with scikit-learn on the digits dataset.

This project uses Python and its libraries to explore digits data with the help of matplotlib, work with the well-known algorithms KMeans and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to construct models, to fit the data to these models, to predict values and to validate the models build.
